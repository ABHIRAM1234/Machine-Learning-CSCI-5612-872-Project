            <h1>Fire in Focus: Analyzing the Causes and Patterns of Wildfires</h1>
        
            <h2>The Nature of the Topic</h2>
            <p>Does climate change, human activity, and environmental factors influence the frequency and severity of wildfires, and how can predictive models help mitigate these impacts on health, infrastructure, and biodiversity?            </p>
            <p>The rise in global temperatures and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events have led to an alarming increase in wildfires worldwide. In 2020, wildfires burned more than 10 million acres in the United States alone, affecting thousands of homes, displacing entire communities, and causing millions of dollars in damages. The causes of these fires are complex and multifaceted, driven by both natural factors and human-induced climate change. High temperatures, prolonged droughts, and mismanagement of natural resources have contributed to the spread and intensity of these fires, particularly in regions like California, where wildfires have become a recurring annual event. The impacts of wildfires extend beyond the immediate destruction of land and property; they also severely affect air quality, with smoke and particulate matter (PM 2.5) causing respiratory issues, heart disease, and exacerbating conditions like asthma. In addition, the environmental destruction caused by wildfires disrupts ecosystems, leading to biodiversity loss and long-term soil degradation. In 2020, over 1 million acres of agricultural land were lost to wildfires in California, highlighting the economic consequences as well. This project seeks to explore how data analysis and predictive models, such as machine learning and satellite imagery, can help forecast wildfire outbreaks, enabling better preparation and response to mitigate the devastating effects on human health, infrastructure, and ecosystems            </p>

            </div>
        
            <h2>Why Wildfire Analysis is Important</h2>
            <p>Wildfires are a growing concern, exacerbated by climate change and the increasing vulnerability of highly urbanized areas. The risk of wildfires is high in the United States, especially across grasslands, forests, and agricultural land, which can lead to devastating consequences including desertification, soil erosion, and loss of agricultural productivity. Moreover, wildfires alter landscapes, damage infrastructure, and harm biodiversity, making it essential to develop effective fire prevention and mitigation strategies.</p>
        
            <p>Beyond the environmental impact, wildfires have far-reaching economic and social consequences. This project aims to help communities prepare for wildfires by predicting when and where they are likely to occur, thus safeguarding human life, natural habitats, and economic activities. The long-term goal is to protect both people and wildlife, reducing the impact of these devastating events.</p>

            </div>
        
            <h2>Who is Affected?</h2>
            <p>Wildfires affect not just the immediate area but also entire regions, displacing people, destroying homes, and impacting mental health. Communities living near wildlands are particularly vulnerable. For firefighters and emergency responders, the physical and psychological toll is immense, often leading to exhaustion, burnout, and PTSD. Firefighters risk their lives daily to protect people and the environment, working under extreme conditions with limited resources. It's crucial to provide support for these heroes, both during and after their service.</p>

            </div>
        
            <p>Governments play a crucial role in managing the aftermath of a wildfire. They are responsible for making decisions related to evacuations, resource deployment, and providing public safety. Moreover, long-term recovery efforts can take years and require significant investments in rebuilding infrastructure. This project highlights the importance of interagency cooperation in managing these efforts efficiently.</p>

            </div>
        
            <p>Wildfires also devastate ecosystems, displacing wildlife and reducing biodiversity. Studies from events such as the 2020 Australia bushfires, where nearly 3 billion animals were killed or displaced, show the far-reaching consequences for animal populations and ecosystems. Soil erosion, water runoff, and reduced air quality further compound these impacts, emphasizing the need for comprehensive ecosystem management strategies that consider both human and environmental factors.</p>

            </div>
        
            <h2>What has been done so far, and what are the gaps?</h2>
            <p>While significant progress has been made in wildfire prediction, much work remains to address the growing threat. Satellite imagery, remote sensing, and machine learning algorithms are transforming the way wildfire data is collected and analyzed. However, there are gaps in integrating real-time data from multiple sources, and many existing models do not consider human factors, such as evacuation patterns. Furthermore, predicting fire behavior is still a challenging task due to the complexities of the environment and climate variability.</p>
        
            <div class="image-container">

            </div>
        
            <p>Data mining and analytics play a crucial role in understanding wildfire behavior. By analyzing historical fire data, meteorological conditions, and real-time reports, we can improve fire prediction models and enhance risk management. Predictive modeling techniques such as clustering, classification, and machine learning have helped guide controlled burns and firebreak construction, reducing the risk of uncontrolled fires.</p>
        
            <div class="image-container">

            <h2>Understanding Satellite Instruments: MODIS and VIIRS</h2>
            <p>MODIS: Launched in 1999, MODIS is a scanning radiometer that captures data in 36 spectral bands, ranging from visible to thermal infrared wavelengths. It offers global coverage with a spatial resolution of 250 to 1000 meters, depending on the spectral band. MODIS plays a vital role in monitoring land cover, sea surface temperatures, atmospheric properties, and more</p>
            <p>VIIRS on Suomi NPP (SNPP): Launched in 2011, the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite carries the VIIRS instrument, which features 22 spectral bands spanning from 412 nm to 12 µm. It provides global coverage with a swath width of 3060 km and a spatial resolution of 375 to 750 meters, depending on the spectral band. VIIRS on SNPP continues the legacy of MODIS, offering enhanced capabilities for monitoring Earth's surface, atmosphere, and oceans</p>
            <p>VIIRS on NOAA-21: Launched in November 2022, NOAA-21 is the latest addition to the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) series. It carries an advanced VIIRS instrument with similar spectral bands and spatial resolutions as its predecessors. NOAA-21's VIIRS enhances the continuity and quality of environmental data records, supporting improved weather forecasting and climate monitoring</p>

            <p>The column CONFIDENCE has mixed data types. The confidence levels are low(l), nominal(n), and high(h). Only about 15% of the data within the confidence attribute is numeric,
                so the values were binned into different ranges. Daytime fire pixels with low confidence are linked to sun glint and lower relative temperature anomalies (<15K)
                   in mid-infrared channel I4. Nominal confidence pixels are those without sun glint and with a temperature anomaly of >15K

                     wildfires with a target label of 1. The rows that remained unmerged correspond to instances
                      where wildfires did not occur. To achieve a balanced
                       dataset, we quantified the positive class labels from 2020 to 2024 and subsequently conducted a random 
                       sampling of an equivalent number of data points from the unmatched dataset. This produced an equal
                        quantity of positive and negative class labels, with 56,948 instances for each. The data set comprises
                         a total of 113,896 rows.</div>
