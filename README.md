# Fire in Focus: An Analytical Approach to Wildfire Prediction

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a group project completed as part of the Data Mining course (CSCI 5502-872). The project focuses on analyzing and predicting wildfire occurrences using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Wildfires pose a significant threat to ecosystems and human communities. In this project, we developed predictive models using satellite and weather data to identify key factors contributing to wildfire risks and predict their occurrences. The project aims to assist in proactive wildfire management and resource allocation.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Processed large-scale satellite and weather datasets.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Developed classification models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest) achieving 87% accuracy and an AUC score of 0.93.
- **Feature Engineering**: Applied advanced feature selection and engineering techniques.
- **Model Interpretability**: Utilized SHAP values to identify the most critical factors influencing predictions.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git for version control
